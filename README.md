## Storage Drive for Enterprises

Implement a Storage Drive for digital assets which can be adopted by enterprises and integrated with their other systems. Existing services such as Google Drive or DropBox donâ€™t provide this flexibility and also increase the storage cost. You will start by building the basic functionality like authentication, uploads, downloads, organizing (folders), viewing and deleting files on a user friendly interface. You will take it to the next level by making it scalable and implementing additional features like favourites, recent uploads, and link based sharing. You will also implement API based upload/download that enables customers to integrate it with their workflows and other systems.
